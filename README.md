# portfolio-website - jamestw13.github.io

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create a static website to display a mock portfolio.

### This was completed by...

- [x] Presenting the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- [x] The links in the navigation bar link to the corresponding sections
- [x] The section about their work contains titled images of the developer's applications
- [x] The developer's first application is larger in size than the others
- [x] Clicking the images of the applications takes the user to that deployed application
- [x] The page is responsive to resizing various screens and devices

### Note - since this is only a mock portfolio:

- The resume link does not yet function
- In the contact links, the phone number is fake (it perhaps calls Jenny)
- The twitter link leads to the twitter main page
